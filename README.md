# non-invasive-glucometer
This project presents a low-cost, pain-free non-invasive glucometer using optical sensors and Arduino. It aims to estimate blood glucose levels without skin penetration by analyzing light reflectance from the fingertip using the TCRT1000 infrared sensor. The device is also integrated with the MAX30100 sensor for displaying BPM and SpOâ‚‚ levels.
